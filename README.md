# Snake-Ladder
A snake &amp; ladder game with a tiny twist,  all the snakes/ladders are hidden, until found.

Currently has a maximum of 4 players, and tiles must be multiples of 10.
The GUI is still plain.

any Image can represent a Ladder of a Snake, 
As long as the Pirctures are in a folder named: "res" on the same folder as the game & the picture that is supposed to be a Snake is named: "snake_head_trans.png" & the Ladder is nammed: "ladder_trans.png"

The Snakes & ladders are initialized automatically at the start of the game to random places.
